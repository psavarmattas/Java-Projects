# JAVA Programs For Everybody To Try!

_`Last Updated: April 14' 2021`_

## Introduction:

Here are programs that every budding programmer who is learning to code in Java should start with. 
These programs are a compilation of many different types of programs and levels of programming you should try.
If you want to start with levels of coding in mind use the table (serial)  to refer which program is of which category.
If you want in which serial you should code rather than the levels then refer to table (levels) for a better understanding.

## Pre-Requisites:

1. A coding IDE or just use the CMD/Terminal on your Windows Pc/Mac respectively (I used VS Code for this).

2. Check that Java is properly installedin your system and the Path to Java is integratively set in your system.

3. Start by trying to create the program by yourself if you encounter any problems refer to the code in the program file, 
if the problem still persist then create a issue or use Google/Stack Overlflow for help.

4. Done! You have successfully created the program in Java by your own.
